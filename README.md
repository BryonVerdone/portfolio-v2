# Mock Developer Portfolio
A mock web developer portfolio page created from a Figma design 


Link to project: https://mockportfolio.netlify.app/




# How It's Made
Tech used:  HTML, CSS, Javascript, Figma

This was my first time implementing a Figma design into a working page. I organized the different assets (photos,icons) into separate folders. Color values were stored inside CSS variables for easy use when styling the page. Both flexbox and grid were used to layout the content on the page. In order to make the page fully responsive media queries were used at different screen widths. I also added some JavaScript functionality to both show and hide a mobile menu on smaller screen sizes









# Lessons Learned:
As I went through each section of the page I would grab the assets from Figma. I should have spent some time in the beginning organizing all of the assets, colors and fonts for the page so I could quickly implement them when the time came. The most challenging part of this project was learning about and navigating Figma. I went into this project knowing very little about Figma but was able to figure out how components are nested, where to get color values and how to export assets.
